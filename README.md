# Products Tracker
Hello 🙋‍♂
This simple CRUDS (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search) application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript) to manage a list of products. This project allows users to add, update, delete, and search for products. All data is stored locally using localStorage, making it easy to use without the need for a backend server and is checked using regular expression.

## Features
- Create Products: Enter product details like name, price, category, and description.
- Read Products: Products are displayed in table html tag for semantic purposes
- Update Products: Modify existing product details.
- Delete Products: Remove products from the list.
- Search Products: Filter through products by name, price, category, or description.
- Data Persistence: Product data is stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions.
